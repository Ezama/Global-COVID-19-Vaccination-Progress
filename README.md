# Global-COVID-19-Vaccination-Progress
In this project, I analyzed global COVID-19 vaccination data from February 2021 to January 2022 to understand key trends and patterns. The analysis focused on the progress of vaccinations across countries, continents, and manufacturers. Key insights revealed that China led in total vaccinations, with significant global increases in June, August, and December 2021. We also observed a strong performance by Pfizer and Moderna as leading vaccine manufacturers, with Europe and North America dominating total vaccinations.

Visualizations and statistical analysis were performed using Python and PowerBI, identifying trends in daily vaccinations, geographic differences, and manufacturer performance. The project provided actionable recommendations to enhance vaccination distribution and improve preparedness for future global health challenges.

This project is an example of using real-world data to draw meaningful insights and influence public health decisions.
